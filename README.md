# This project aims to build and develop an integral system for automatic testing and diagnostics for electronic boards, relying on CAN-FD communication between the Nucleo-G431RB board and a SEG-Automotive client board. Through an interface developed with LabVIEW, the administrator can adjust system parameters, transmit frames, and visualize communication results to automatically store data in CSV files.
